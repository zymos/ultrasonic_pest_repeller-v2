# Description

A humane pest repeller designed to be extreamly annoying... to pests.  It beeps ultrasonic in 5 different frequencies at random durrations and pauses, also flashing LEDs.  This is designed to be used in crawl spaces, attics, garages, sheds, RVs in storage.  It makes popping sounds when beeps turn on and off so may be annoying to humans if put in a place you sleep or spend time in.  The code uses the MCU's high speed PWM, so you can not use most common MCUs.  I used a very old MCU because I had a bunch of them.  There are some more modern MCUs but you will have to modify the code.

# Bill of materials
* Attiny26 microcontroller
* NPN transistor or mosfet
* Ultrasonic speaker
* Resistor: 100 Ohm 1/2W
* Resistor: 470 Ohm 1/4W
* Capacitor: 1.0uF or 0.1uF
* 12V power supply, 1A is more than enough
